Uber-Data-Analysis
🔍 Problem Identification: In this personal project, I took on the challenge of addressing issues related to ride cancellations and non-availability of cars for specific routes within my city. These issues had a significant impact on the Uber experience for both riders and drivers.

📊 Data-Driven Analysis: Leveraging my data analysis skills, transformed data as per the problem statement and delved into the vast datasets using tools such as Python, NumPy, and Pandas, to discover hidden patterns, trends, and factors contributing to these challenges. This analytical phase was foundational to the success of the project.

📈 Strategies and Recommendations: Based on the insights derived from data analysis, I formulated data-driven strategies and recommendations. These strategies were thoughtfully designed to bridge the supply-demand gap and minimize the occurrence of ride cancellations while ensuring a smoother car availability process for specific routes.

🧪 Testing and Implementation: To validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, Continuous monitoring of results and adjustments were integral to refining the approaches and achieving tangible improvements. Tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn were instrumental in visualizing the impact.

✅ Positive Impact: The outcomes were promising. Ride cancellations significantly decreased, and car availability on the specified routes improved. The project contributed not only to enhancing the ride-sharing experience but also to building stronger rider and driver satisfaction.
