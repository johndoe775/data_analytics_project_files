# Zomato-Sales-Analysis-Project-Using-SQL
This project is a focused data analysis of Zomato sales using SQL, examining user purchase behaviors, product popularity, and membership effects through SQL queries. While the dataset is compact, the project leverages advanced SQL techniques to answer a variety of complex analytical questions.

**Key Analysis Highlights:**

1. Customer Spending Patterns: Calculation of each user's total expenditure, identifying high-value customers.
2. User Engagement: Tracking unique visit days per user, providing insight into customer retention.
3. Product Preferences: Determination of each user's initial purchase and their most frequently purchased items, enabling product-based segmentation.
4. Membership Analysis: Investigation into the impact of the Zomato Gold membership, analyzing purchases before and after joining.
5. Points System Simulation: Implemented a points-earning mechanism based on item prices, calculating total points accumulated and the most rewarded products.
6. Transaction Rankings: Assigns ranks to customer transactions, differentiating member and non-member purchases, adding depth to customer journey analysis.

This project demonstrates practical SQL skills applicable to business analytics, focusing on deriving meaningful insights from limited but valuable data.
